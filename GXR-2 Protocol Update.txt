Status messages are multicast messages sent from the GXR2 to controllers

Multicast Status Message IPs and their associated zones are as follows
232.0.0.1	Zone 1
232.0.0.2	Zone 2
232.0.0.3	Zone 3
232.0.0.4	Zone 4
232.0.0.5	Zone 5
232.0.0.6	Zone 6

Other multicast traffic seen on Wireshark (I'm not sure what these are used for)
232.0.0.129	
232.0.0.130	
232.0.0.131	
232.0.0.132	
232.0.0.133	
232.0.0.134	

Status messages are sent at periodic intervals (approximately .7 seconds)  and whenever a change is made to the status of a zone.

When a zone is turned off, the status messages for that zone are abbreviated to 19 bytes in length.  When the zone is turned on, the status message is 49 bytes in length.  The status of zone elements are spread out in the message.  Precise locations are as follows:

Zone number     Byte 3
Device number   Byte 12
Volume          Byte 23


Command messages are unicast messages sent from controllers to the GXR2.

The command string is an 11 byte string of the format

00 XX 06 ZZ 00 0b 00 06 <command> 00 ff 

Where XX is a sequence number that is not used by the system and ZZ is the
zone number:

Zone 1 = 21
Zone 2 = 22
Zone 3 = 23
Zone 4 = 24
Zone 5 = 25
Zone 6 = 26
