These instructions are under construction and are subject to daily updates.

The following components are required to complete this project:

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ or newer
Raspberry Pi power supply
Raspberry Pi case
Micro SD card
USB keyboard/mouse
HDMI Monitor
Network patch cable (to connect Raspberry Pi to Niles GXR2)
Network capable computer to download Raspbian software and install it on Micro SD card
SD memory card adapter for computer (some computers have integrated SD slots, or a USB adapter can be used)
Device with a web browser on the same local network as the Raspberry Pi wireless connection

Software:

Raspbian Buster operating system
Files from this repository

Main steps to complete the project:

1.  Insert the SD card into the computer
2.  Download the latest version of NOOBS from the Raspberry Pi Site and install it on the Micro SD card.
3.  Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and apply power to it.
4.  Run the NOOBS install and select raspbian as the operating system.
5.  Complete the post install configuration and reboot the Raspberry Pi.
6.  Enable the wireless network on the Raspberry Pi.7
7.  Install apache and php
8.  Download files from this repository to the Raspberry Pi.
9.  Create a file in the /home/pi directory called GXR2status.txt.  The contents of the file should be six zeroes.
10.  Compile the getstatus.cpp file and run it in its own terminal session.
11  Connect the Raspberry Pi to the expansion port on the back of the Niles GXR2.
12. Use the ifconfig command to get the IP address of the wireless connection.
13. Type the IP address into the address window on a web browser on a network capable device that is part of your 
    local area network(for example, if your IP is 192.168.0.100, you would type http://192.168.0.100 in the address 
    text box at the top of the browser.)
14. Navigate by clicking on the buttons on the displays that are provided by the Raspberry Pi.
